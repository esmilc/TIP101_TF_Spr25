Problem 2: Find Last Node in a Linked List Cycle
Given the head of a singly linked list, write a function that returns the last node in the cycle. If there is no cycle in the linked list, return None.

def find_last_node_in_cycle(head):
	pass
Example Input: num1 -> num2 -> num3 -> num4 -> num2

Example Output: num4

ðŸ’¡ Hint: Multiple Pass Technique
This problem may require multiple traversals of the list. For reference, check out the Unit 6 Cheatsheet or practice your independent research skills using a search engine or generative AI tool.
