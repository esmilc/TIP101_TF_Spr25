Step 1: Copy the following code into Replit.

Step 2: Add a line of code (outside of the class) to instantiate an instance of the class Pokemon and store it in a variable named my_pokemon. The Pokemon instance created should have name "Pikachu" and its types should be ["Electric"].

class Pokemon:
    def __init__(self, name, types):
        self.name = name
        self.types = types
        self.is_caught = False
